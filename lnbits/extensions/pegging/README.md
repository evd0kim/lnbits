# Pegged Assets

## Keep a pegged balance in a wallet

ALL funds initally in the wallet and all funds added later to the wallet will be pegged to FIAT currency, or basket of asset (coming soon) value.

### Creating a peg

1. Enable extension
2. Add kollider detais (should be on your own LNbits, or an install you trust very much)
3. Name the peg, select a wallet, select a percentage of the funds that should be pegged (80% max, 20% min float for trades)
4. Select a currency
